## 🧠 Geeky Facts  
- 🌟 **AI Fact:** 80% of my time is spent cleaning data, but it's 100% fun.  
- 🦠 **VirFact:** There are more viruses on Earth than stars in the universe, with an estimated 10^31 virus particles.  
- 🎮 **Trivia:** My favorite IDE is always set to "dark mode." Who needs extra light when you're debugging at 2 AM? 😎
